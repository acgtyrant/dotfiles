dotfiles
========

I am [Using GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html), I arrange my all dotfiles here, and there are many comments and references to ArchWiki inside them, which are very helpful.

By the way, I write some scripts to reinstall Arch Linux quickly, but they are
not practical as so far.
