dotfiles
========

Hi, it's my all config here, just ake whatever you prefer. I hope they are helpful.

However, you may notice that how difficulty to manage these dotfiles while they are so separate. So you can use stow to link them to the suitable place. Just read this [article][1] to see how do it, it will.
